    <h1>November 2020</h1>
    <p>
        The month I decided to switch over to differnt footwear. I began exploring between two styles of shoes which were the jordan 1s and dunks as they were the ones that got my most attention
    </p>
    <p>
        I saw the there was a lot of hype for these type of shoes and began to get curious on how to obtain them.

        <h1>February 2021, the start...</h1>
        <p> 
            After a few months into sneakers I realized the chances of obtaining them manually was very low. The rise of bots were making it increasingly difficult for anyone to obtain shoes. Which led me to wanting to learn how to bot. I began researching and learing from tops botters.
        </p>
        I needed a few things..
        <ul>
            <Li>A bot</Li>
            <Li>A cookgroup</Li>
            <Li>Proxies</Li>
            <Li>Credit Cards</Li>
         </ul>
         <h2>The Bots:</h2>

         <p>
             Nike Shoe bot was the first bot I sought out since it was in stock compared to the other bots. The reason being is the better the bot the more exlusive it was to obtain. At the time the resell for these bots were drastically inflated due to the pandemic and everyone botting. The prices would range above 5k for these high end softwares. I quickly realized that to be successful in this field I would need a better software which is where Prism came along.
        </p> 

        <h2>The cookgroup:</h2>
        <p>
            I joined Soelus for the rest of 2021 since they becamed partner with Prism. This meant if selected I could own Prism within my monthly subscription. Along with including monthly subscription and the bot, I also recieved the perks the group had to offer which were proxies.
         </p>
         <h2>Proxies:</h2>
         <p>
             Proxies were a little more complicated due to the nature of the business. Proxies are IP addressed that help you checkout multiple pairs of shoes with your credit cards to avoid the websites from knowing its a single person. If you attempted to check out shoes on your local IP most of your orders would cancel. However proxies solve the problem. The issue with proxies is when the company sells the same proxies to multiple users they get banned thus resulting in no results which means money was wasted. I had to experiment differnt proxies until I found what worked best for me. There are two types of proxies: 
         </p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <Th>Residential</Th>
                    <Th>ISP/DC</Th>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                    <td>Data Restricted (GB)</td>
                    <td>Unlimited</td>    
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
             </table>

             <p>
                 Residentail Proxies are slower in speed but less likely to be banned. Also youre able to generate thousands at a time. The downside is you have to be wary of the data you burn as you run for a drop. Ideally you want to have sufficient data or you run the risk of losing checkouts in the middle of the drop.
             </p>
             <p>
                 ISP/DC proxies are the alternative which are faster than residential proxies and are more likely to get banned if you are not careful with your monitoring and check out delays. However these can be ran 24/7 if you run them on proper delays. The down side is theyre typically more pricy and come in smaller bundles of 25,50,75,100 etc.
             </p>

             <h1>Credit Cards:</h1>
             <p>
                 Credit Cards are possibly the simpler part of the process as you just need to generate virtual credit cards. With AYCD, youre able to generate 20 a day and once generated you can create unique information for each profile to avoid cancelations and then upload them to your bot. 
             </p>
         </div>

         <div>
             <h1>Putting it all together:</h1>
                 <p>
                    Once you obtain the bot of your choice, upload your profiles to the bot and your proxies. Most bots have the shoes that are coming out soon on their home page. Select the site you want to bot and from there select the profiles and proxies you want to run for the profiles. The bot will atomatically send those profiles to your task menu and you simply start when the developer indicates it time to start.
